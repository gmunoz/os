- After each context switch the TLB needs to be flushed. Make sure to
  actually implement this in the stack-swapping routine.
- Remove itoa from lib/gnu.c ... one step closer to removing this file.
- Change the CHECK_FLAG and bit_pos functions to be a single macro
  specific to each bit check case. So CHECK_MAP_FIXED and CHECK_KERNEL,
  should exist, and each of those macros should have the hard-coded bit
  positions to be more efficient than the current methods.
- Re-implement the physical page allocator using the buddy system and
  include functionality for allocating contiguous memory, and split the
  memory allocated by DMA and non-DMA.
- Get kernel modules to load/run (easier said than done)
- Write a better video handler (probably just do this as I need it).
- Mutual Exclusion (semaphores)
  See Dijkstra
- Random number generator
  See Knuth
  May want to assess how other OS's manage random number generation.
