All code here is licensed under the GNU General Public License. Please
see the file COPYING located in the top-level source directory for a
copy of this license. Some of the code was borrowed as per the GPL of
other projects. It should be noted where this was done in the source
files. Other code was taken from publications, such as books, and is
also noted in the source files.

Toolchain
=========

The primary toolchain used to develop this kernel is:
  GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>
	  or
  Intel C Compiler (tested ICC-8.1)
  Binutils <http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/>
  NASM <http://nasm.sourceforge.net/>

However the Intel C/C++ Compiler will also work with this release (and
is quite useful when GCC gets into "funk" mode). See the INSTALL file
for detailed instructions on how to compile this code, and the makefile
targets available.

Syntax Notes
============

- The C keyword `restrict' is part of the C99 standard. Use --std=c99 to
  enable this mode (it is not in this mode by default, at least not 100%
  in this mode). See Section 6.7.3.1 of the ISO C99 Standard.
- gcc -fsyntax-only => specifies compiler to check for syntax only.
